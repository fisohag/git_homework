Did you soak the rice in the water before you mixed it ? how many minutes or hours? Thank you. It looks very yummy.

Hi. No, I didn’t. Instead, we bring the rice and chicken to a boil and let the oven do the finishing touch for 30-35 minutes UNCOVERED.

Chicken and rice is a classic combination of flavor and taste. You can’t deny it. All glory from chicken juice is passed down to rice; and of course flavor slowly passes down to the rice. At the end the explosion of the flavor is unbelievable.

Hi Imma, interesting recipe. I know this is not authentic Indian biryani but it sounds good. Indian cuisine is one of my favorite but the sheer complexity and time-consuming aspect of it mightily deter me from cooking Indian food more often. Even the simplest vegetable side dish is relatively complex and as someone with chronic tiredness it can be overwhelming. So recipes like this one, while not authentic, are very much welcome when I am in the mood for something vaguely Indian and tasty in its own right. So thank you.
(Also I have improved my heat tolerance by a lot…so I don’t feel like chickening out on chilies anymore. Yay!)

Hi Chery, It’s called raita. And it’s made with greek yogurt,(vegetables; cucumber, tomatoes, ) and fruits(mango )and spices such as cumin; herbs mint , parsley and/or cilantro). Here’s a good reference http://www.whitbitskitchen.com/2013/03/06/raita-a-cooling-yogurt-sauce/.

Hello Imma. Been following you for awhile. Thank you. Thank you. Can i ask,what if you can’t put the rice in oven? can it be cooked on just the cooker?

Reply
ImmaculateBites says

24 Apr, 2018 at 10:42 pm

Hello Ogo, Yes, it can be cooked entirely stove top but you would have to sacrifice the crispy skin. Follow steps as follows, cover with a tight fitting lid. Reduce heat to almost a simmer and cook until chicken is cooked through.

I’m a novice in the arena of cooking. I have not used cardamom ever. I just have few things to clarify if you don’t mind. What does cardamom pods cracked teaspoon means? When you mentioned chill or chilli spice did you mean chili powder or chilli flakes? Thank you so much. Your recipes are so appealing and tempting. I’m always looking forward for more palatable dishes every week.

That’s a dish that deserves to be on everyone regular rotation because that’s a flavorbomb of a dish, mine included. That dish alone uses up just about the vast majority of spices in most people’s pantry. Put it on regular rotation it easily consumes most your spices for consumption. It very much reminds me of Caribbean Chicken & Rice though some slight differences. Awesome for a One Pot Meal as well. In my case that also would be an entire weeks meal. I’ll only need to cook once all week with that dish !

Easy Jambalaya - Immaculate Bites says:

[…] Both gumbo and jambalaya are quint-essentials to the Southern cuisine. These two are packed with so much proteins like chicken, shrimp, and sausages. But the difference between a gumbo and a jambalaya is that a gumbo is a soup or stew while jambalaya is a rice-based dish – more like biryani, paella or biryani. […]
